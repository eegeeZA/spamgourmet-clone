<b>Privacy policy</b>
<br>Your privacy and the integrity of the information you provide this site (your email address) are the primary reasons this site exists.  This is a non-commercial service -- no value is placed on your information, and no gain will be derived from the possession of it.  We will not provide this information under any circumstances to any party other than duly authorized law enforcment officials, or a court of competent jurisdiction and only in connection with a legitimate investigation.  
<p>
We have never sent a broadcast message to our users via their email addresses and probably never will (we do post notices on the BBS and via twitter sometimes).  This means that if you care to keep up with news about the service, you will need to check the website or bbs (or twitter) every once in a while.
<p><b>Information collected by this site</b>
<br>In order for the service to function, you must provide an email address at which you can receive email.  Other than that, no personal information is collected about you.  Our code does not store email in any way.  It is either immediately forwarded to your email address or erased in volatile memory.  Information collected by this site is and will be used for no purpose other than to provide this service, and will not be transferred to other parties.
<p><b>Cookies</b>
<br>For authenticated sessions, this site uses session cookies which remain in your computer's memory until you log out or close your browser.  This site does not use persistent cookies by default and stores no information on your computer between sessions, unless you request such cookies by clicking the appropriate options.
<p><b>Privacy contact</b>
<br>If you have any questions about these policies, <a href="/contact.html">please contact us</a>.
